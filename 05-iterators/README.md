# Iterators

We now get to the functional language aspects of Rust. This covers closures and
iterators. Don't get scared by them. It might take some time to get used to
them, but if you got the hang of it, you can't go back to languages without
them.

## Task

As always, the program has some bugs. And as always, the compiler is happy to
help you to fix them. Do this and experiment a bit with iterators. After you
think you're done, ask `cargo clippy` what it thinks about your code. It usually
has strong opinions about usage of iterators and their methods.
