# Traits

Traits bring a object oriented character to Rust. You can look at them as
interfaces in other languages.

## Task

Fix the code by implementing the missing trait functions.

## Bonus

Currently the `animals_do_animal_things` can only be called with two animals of
the same type. Change the code so that you can pass arbitrary types that
implement the `AnimalBehavior` trait. Hint: You'll need generics.
