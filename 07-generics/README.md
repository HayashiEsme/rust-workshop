# Generics

Of better: Generics & Lifetimes. But lifetimes are scary, and I don't want to
scare you in the title.

## Task

Make it compile. On the one hand this task will show you generics in Rust, which
are just what you expect.

On the other hand this task forces you to think a bit about lifetimes. But don't
worry, there are only 3 or 4 rules you really have to keep in mind when working
with lifetimes, that can't be too hard. And it's 2020, the compiler will help
you out quite a bit, not like back in my days!

## Bonus

If you understood lifetimes, I recommend you this chapter of the Rustonomicon:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/ownership.html. You can read it. But getting
really comfortable with lifetimes needs hands on experience. Learning by
~~suffering~~ doing!
